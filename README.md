## Jekyll / deck.js Presentation Template

* Recursively clone this repository.
* Write your presentation under `_posts` (one per slide).
* Run [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).
* Your presentation will be under `_site`, with
  [deck.js](http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/) included.

Jekyll unfortunately requires that each slide be an individual file
under `_posts` if you're using something other than HTML.
